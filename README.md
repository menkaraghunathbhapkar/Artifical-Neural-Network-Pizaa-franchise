Build a model where it accepts the images of pizza and detects as burnt pizza or good pizza.
A famous 30 year old pizza brand which has outlets in more than 90 countries started home delivery services a couple of years ago and the business has grown much faster than expected. However, outlet vendors are very much disappointed with few customers for their cheating activities. This is because vendors, shockingly, came to know that few customers after receiving the delivery are raising tickets for refund in the name of burnt pizzas. Even though customers received a good pizza but still few customers are trying to cheat vendors. To overcome this issue, Franchise has come up with an idea to integrate a pizza detection model in their application where customers can upload images for the burnt pizzas delivered. For example, if I have received a burnt pizza then I can upload a couple of images of the pizza to the application and it will classify the pizza as burnt or good in order to process my refund ticket.
