Build a model where it accepts the images of pizza and detects as burnt pizza or good pizza.
A famous 30 year old pizza brand which has outlets in more than 90 countries started home delivery services a couple of years ago and the business has grown much faster than expected. However, outlet vendors are very much disappointed with few customers for their cheating activities. This is because vendors, shockingly, came to know that few customers after receiving the delivery are raising tickets for refund in the name of burnt pizzas. Even though customers received a good pizza but still few customers are trying to cheat vendors. To overcome this issue, Franchise has come up with an idea to integrate a pizza detection model in their application where customers can upload images for the burnt pizzas delivered. For example, if I have received a burnt pizza then I can upload a couple of images of the pizza to the application and it will classify the pizza as burnt or good in order to process my refund ticket.

Goal: You are hired as Deep Learning Engineer by a famous pizza franchise. You are asked to build a model where it accepts the images of pizza and detects as burnt pizza or good pizza.

Constraints: You should be using only ANN and shouldnâ€™t be using CNN or any other rule based
model to generate results.

Data Description: Data is in the form of images collected from multiple sources of the internet.

Provided Files:
Train set: Train set is divided into burnt pizza and good pizza categories. While training the model you can label images of good pizza as 1 and burnt pizza as 0.
Test: Test set contains mixed images of both burnt pizzas and good pizzas.

Instructions:
1. Train set should be used to feed the model.
2. Test set should be used to predict labels for test data.


Evaluation Criteria: The evaluation metric for this problem statement is the Accuracy score where each image label is matched with the actual image label.
